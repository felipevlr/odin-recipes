    <p>This cheesy white sauce is perfect for any pasta but works best with spaghetti or cavatappi. I favor butcher bacon as it's the best bacon on the planet! Kids attacked the leftover pasta and ate the bacon and sun-dried tomatoes before I was able to get a photo!</p>

        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or more as needed</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add spaghetti and a liberal amount of salt to the boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain pasta and transfer to a large serving bowl. Reserve 1 cup pasta water.</li>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <li>While pasta is cooking, coat chicken with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken and chop into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.</li>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <li>Add bacon to the same pan and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and cut into small pieces.</li>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <li>Add sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes to the bacon fat and cook for 1 minute. Add chicken and bacon and reduce heat to just above a simmer. Stir in milk and cornstarch. Add chicken broth, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese; stir and simmer until well mixed and cheeses have melted</li>
        <p class="space"></p>
        <li>Slowly add 1/2 cup pasta water to the sauce; stir and allow the sauce to thicken up to desired consistency, adding more pasta water as needed. Pour sauce over pasta to serve.</li>
